      "hooks": {
        "pre-commit": "pretty-quick --staged"
      }

```

## TODO

- View reports: If you open the index.html file in browser located at coverage/lcov-report folder you will be able to view the report
- Recommended VS code extensions
- Have separe section on testing
  - https://react-testing-examples.com/
  - When writing tests, think of http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert
  - React Testing lib cheat sheet https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet
  - Dark mode theme
- My VS code snippets: https://gist.github.com/cmacdonnacha/334ef14cb301c426ee6eb166eb500a5a
- Link to others as well as I don't have many
- in VS code, enable editor on save. Perhaps store my settings as gist as well?
